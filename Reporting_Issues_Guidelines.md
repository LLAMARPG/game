- Try to avoid duplicating already existing issues. If an issue is already open for a bug you've found, then it doesn't need to be reported again. If you have further information or context to add, then you can leave a comment under the existing issue.
- Sometimes I forget which bugs I've fixed. I try to label them in the Issues page with the tag 'potentially-fixed'. If the bug does not occur for you at all, reporting that would be handy so I can close the issue.
- Some bugs, glitches, or problems can cover a wide base of things. An example being clipping into the map or poorly setup collision boxes for tiles. Both of these are the same issue, and all instances of them should be part of one issue. Each collision/clipping issue/example does not need its own issue.
- Please try to include logs when possible, especially with crashes. The logs are located in Godot's user folder. [See the table here to find it on your OS](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/io/data_paths.html#accessing-persistent-user-data-user). Some builds of the game will have very noisy logs (meaning a lot of text). You can cut text out of it that you know is not relevant if you want. Feel free to upload the text file itself or copy and paste the entirety of the log into an issue, but please format it if you do insert the text straight into the issue. You would do so by surrounding the text with \``` your text here ```.
